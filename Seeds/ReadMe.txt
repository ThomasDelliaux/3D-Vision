TP3 Seeds.

This program , firstly, computes the disparity map associated to a pair of images by computing the disparity which maximize the normalized cross-correlation for each patch of image 1, 
and then displays the obtained disparity map.
After that, it computes the disparity map with the seeds algorithm, and then displays the obtained disparity map.

We can observe that the seeds algorithm gives us a better result, in the sense that the disparity map is more "smooth". With the first method we have a lot of noises.
